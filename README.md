# SMART_GREENHOUSE_MONITORING_SYSTEM

Developed an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project transforms greenhouse management by leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT).Â With sensors constantly monitoring the environment, you can track conditions and even trigger actions based on the readings. This innovative system allows you to ditch the need for constant check-ups and manage your greenhouse remotely, ensuring optimal plant growth.
